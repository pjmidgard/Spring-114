Algorithm: Save size of file. Division plus 1 this and write a bit less or more and multiply by this number back. If prime number -1 and divide. Repeat this many times. The number must be two n like this 2 ** n. E.g.: X bits 2 ** X+2+1 and plus the same bits of long of the times: times (2**X+1)-1. 2-65535 bits. Deep: X + 1 bits. E.g.
Divide by blocks block=Deep2*2. If compress 1 not compress 0.
Deep: X

X+1=32bits.
